# Use else block to display a
# message “Done” after successful
# execution of for loop

# Same as the if statement,
# Python allows us to use an else block
# along with for loop. for loop
# can have the else block, which
# will be executed when the loop
# terminates normally.

for i in range(5):
    print(i)
else:
    print('Done!')
