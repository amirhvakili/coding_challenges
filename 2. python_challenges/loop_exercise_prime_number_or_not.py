# Write a program to display all prime
# numbers within a range
# Note: A Prime Number is a number
# that cannot be made by multiplying
# other whole numbers. A prime number is
# a natural number greater than 1 that is
# not a product of two smaller
# natural numbers

# Examples:

# 6 is not a prime mumber because it can
# be made by 2Ã—3 = 6
# 37 is a prime number because
# no other whole numbers multiply
# together to make it.

# Given:

# # range
# start = 25
# end = 50

# Expected output:

# Prime numbers between 25 and 50 are:
# 29
# 31
# 37
# 41
# 43
# 47
